    <h4>Hey there!</h4>
    <p>K Groups is an app for class-based Slack teams.
        K Groups puts your students into small groups of a few students based on their course progress.
        This helps facilitate natural conversations between peers, reducing isolation, and improving learning outcomes.
    </p>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    <p><strong>Educators</strong> log into K Groups and set up your course structure. A course structure is just a list of tasks
        that students will check off as they begin and complete each task. Once the course structure is
        set up, an instructor can add K Groups to their Slack team. This will import all of the members of the Slack
        team into the K Groups course.</p>

    <p><strong>Students</strong> will simply check off their progress in their task list as they progress through the class.
        They can be enrolled in as many courses (and as many Slack teams) as needed.</p>

    <p><strong>Clusters</strong> of students are computed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering" target="_blank">k-means clustering</a>,
        a simple unsupervised machine learning algorithm to group students into groups with similar progress. These clusters are used to generate Slack channels for the
        students. K Groups handles the creation and invitations. Set it up and let K Groups do the rest.
